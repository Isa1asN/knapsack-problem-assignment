# knapsack-problem-assignment
Another assignment I worked on when taking Fundamentals of AI course, 3rd year 2nd semester

## Format to run the Knapsack implementation:- 
     python main.py --algorithm [algorithmType] --file [knapfile]
  
algorithmType = 'hc' for hill climbing
          * 'sa' for simulated annealing
          * 'ga' for genetic algorithm
