# knapsack-problem-assignment
Another assignment I worked on when taking Fundamentals of AI course, 3rd year 2nd semester

Format to run the Knapsack implementation: 
* python main.py --algorithm [algorithmType] --file knapfile10.txt
  
 * algorithmType = 'hc' for hill climbing
  -                'sa' for simulated annealing
   -               'ga' for genetic algorithm
